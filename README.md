# Otur_CPU_Scheduler

Otur CPU Scheduler, a project from System Programming Courses. The project involves completing functions for the Otur CPU Scheduler, which is part of the StrawHat Virtual Machine (SHVM) used for testing process interactions and custom priority orderings. The completed scheduler will allow the SHVM to simulate multitasking by interleaving Linux programs with custom execution techniques, demonstrating the principles of CPU scheduling and multitasking.
